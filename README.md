# stopTimes

Programs in Maple exploring stopped binary sequences

Say that a binary sequence, indexed from 1, is "stopped at time n" if every
entry in (n/2,n] is 0. The stopping time of a binary sequence is the least
n for which the sequence is stopped at time n, or âˆž if no such n exists. These
programs construct and explore the set of sequences of length n and stopping
time n.
