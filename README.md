# stopTimes
Programs in Maple exploring stopped binary sequences

Say that a binary sequence, indexed from 1, is "stopped at time n" if every entry in (n/2,n] is 0.
The stopping time of a binary sequence b is the least n for which b is stopped at time n.
These programs construct and explore the set of sequences of length n and stopping time n.
